## About this Project

This project started off as a simple distance calculator between two given UK postcodes to be used by small businesses to find optimal delivery routes. However, this has evolved into a much bigger project, where I will be exploring web tech stacks and understanding how one might create, host and maintain a website. 

There is also scope for this project to include other useful business tools, too.

This is just a temporary area for me to work on this project. Ultimately, I may move this repository to something more suitable.

Usage
---
- run `npm run start`
- run `npm run serve`
  
Then, you should be able to access main.html, where the distance calculator will be accessible. The website uses webpack.
